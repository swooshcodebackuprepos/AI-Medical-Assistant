The image shows three separate EKG rhythm strips labeled 1, 2, and 3, each with spaces for rate, rhythm, P wave, PR interval, QRS duration, and interpretation. However, no specific analysis or measurements are filled in. The strips are partially visible and appear low resolution for detailed interpretation.

To provide a proper clinical EKG rhythm strip analysis, the following is needed:
- Clear, higher resolution images of one rhythm strip at a time, showing at least 6 seconds of continuous EKG tracing
- Zoomed view to visualize details such as P waves, PR intervals, QRS complexes, and rhythm regularity
- Numeric measurements or ruler/grid overlays for rate and intervals if possible

Next steps:
- Provide a clear, close-up image of a single EKG rhythm strip
- Ensure the strip includes multiple beats for rhythm evaluation
- If this is part of a quiz or teaching sheet, include any clinical context or patient symptoms

Conclusion:
This image does not clearly show a single EKG rhythm strip for confident rhythm interpretation and analysis. Please supply a clearer, focused rhythm strip image for detailed evaluation.
