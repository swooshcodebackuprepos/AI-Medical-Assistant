The image does not clearly show a single EKG rhythm strip. Instead, it displays multiple small EKG tracings stacked vertically, making it difficult to focus on one rhythm for analysis.

To proceed:
- Provide a clear, close-up image of one specific EKG rhythm strip.
- Ensure the strip is displayed fully with visible P waves, QRS complexes, and regularity for better interpretation.

Once a focused strip is provided, I can analyze the rhythm accordingly.
