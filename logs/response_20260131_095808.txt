1) Most likely rhythm: Unable to determine due to image quality.

2) Supporting features:
- The EKG strip is very small and low resolution.
- Cardiac waveform details including P waves, QRS complexes, and intervals are not clearly visible.
- The strip is too short to assess rhythm regularity or rate accurately.
- No clear ectopy or abnormal complexes can be identified.

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish:
- Cannot differentiate due to insufficient image quality and resolution.

4) Confidence: Low
- Reason: The image does not clearly show an EKG rhythm strip or cardiac waveforms needed for analysis.

5) Safety note:
This is decision-support only; a qualified clinician must confirm all findings. Obtain a higher quality, zoomed, and well-lit EKG rhythm strip showing clear P waves, QRS complexes, and a longer duration strip for accurate rhythm analysis.
