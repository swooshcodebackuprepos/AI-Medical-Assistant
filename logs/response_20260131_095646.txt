The image does not clearly show an EKG rhythm strip. The visible strip is very small, with low resolution and no clear cardiac waveform detail visible.

Next steps:
- Provide a higher quality, zoomed, and well-lit image of the EKG rhythm strip.
- Ensure the strip shows clear P waves, QRS complexes, and a longer duration to assess rhythm features.

Please upload a clearer image of the EKG rhythm strip for analysis.
