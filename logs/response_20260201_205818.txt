The visible screen image shows a clinical decision-support interface analyzing an EKG rhythm strip. The AI's interpretation explains that the rhythm strip is a very rapid, regular wide-complex tachycardia with no discernible P waves, consistent with ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). This contrasts with sinus tachycardia, which would have narrow QRS complexes and visible P waves before each QRS. Key features noted are wide QRS complexes, rapid regular rhythm, absence of visible P waves, and morphology typical of ventricular origin. Confidence is reported as high for V-tach rather than sinus tachycardia.

The webpage visible on the right shows an EKG rhythm strip and a quiz interface asking to select the correct rhythm, with answer options including normal sinus rhythm, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), and atrial flutter.

In summary, the AI's analysis strongly supports the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia based on the rhythm strip features, with high confidence, recommending clinical confirmation.

Confidence: High for ventricular tachycardia as described.

Clinician should confirm diagnosis and management decisions.
