The ECG rhythm strip visible on the screen demonstrates a flat line with no visible P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves. This pattern is consistent with asystole, which is the absence of any electrical cardiac activity.

Clinical features:
- No electrical activity (no discernable waves or complexes)
- Flat baseline

Based on the image, the rhythm corresponds to asystole rather than any other rhythm listed such as sinus rhythms, SVT, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation.

Confidence: High

Note: This is decision-support based on image interpretation; clinician confirmation is essential.
