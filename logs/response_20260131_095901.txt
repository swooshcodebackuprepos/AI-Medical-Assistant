The image does not clearly show an EKG rhythm strip suitable for analysis. The visible strip is very small, with low resolution, and no clear cardiac waveform details are visible.

Next steps:
- Provide a higher quality, zoomed, and well-lit image of the EKG rhythm strip.
- Ensure the strip shows clear P waves, QRS complexes, and a longer duration to assess rhythm features.

Please upload a clearer image of the EKG rhythm strip for analysis.

Safety note: This is decision-support only; a qualified clinician must confirm all findings.
