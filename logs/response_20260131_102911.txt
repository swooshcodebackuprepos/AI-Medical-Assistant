1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 120 beats per minute (estimated by counting large boxes between R waves)
- Regularity: Regular rhythm, consistent R-R intervals
- P waves: Present before each QRS complex, upright and uniform shape
- PR interval: Normal duration, consistent across beats
- QRS width: Narrow, less than 0.12 seconds, indicating normal ventricular conduction
- No ectopy or abnormal waveforms seen

3) Key differentials:
- Atrial tachycardia: Also regular, but P waves may differ in morphology; confirmed by P wave shape and axis differing from sinus P wave.
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): Typically no visible P waves or P waves buried in preceding T waves; sudden onset; rate often faster than sinus tachycardia.
- Sinus arrhythmia: Irregular rhythm with variation in rate related to respiration; here rhythm is regular.

4) Confidence: High, due to presence of regular rate, normal P waves preceding each QRS, and narrow QRS complexes typical of sinus tachycardia.

5) Safety note: This analysis provides decision-support only. Final interpretation and clinical decisions must be confirmed by a qualified clinician.
