1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus rhythm

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 75 beats per minute (counting the number of QRS complexes over the time interval).
- Regularity: Regular rhythm, consistent spacing between QRS complexes.
- P waves: Present before each QRS complex, upright and normal morphology.
- PR interval: Appears consistent and within normal duration.
- QRS width: Narrow, typical duration indicating normal ventricular conduction.
- No ectopy or abnormal beats observed.

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish:
- Sinus bradycardia: Rate would be less than 60 bpm, here the rate is higher.
- Atrial flutter with regular conduction: Would show more atrial activity (sawtooth F waves) and possibly different conduction ratios.
- Atrial fibrillation: Would have irregularly irregular rhythm without distinct P waves.

4) Confidence: High — clear presence of P waves before each QRS, regular rate and rhythm, normal intervals.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm interpretation in clinical context.
