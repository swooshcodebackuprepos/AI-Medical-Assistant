The EKG strip displayed in the image appears to demonstrate sinus rhythm rather than atrial fibrillation. Key observations include:

- Clear, regular P waves preceding each QRS complex, indicating organized atrial depolarization.
- Regular intervals between QRS complexes, suggesting a regular ventricular response.
- Absence of the typical fibrillatory waves seen in atrial fibrillation.

In atrial fibrillation, one would expect to see an irregularly irregular rhythm with absent distinct P waves and fibrillatory baseline activity.

Confidence level: Moderate. This is a decision-support observation based on the visual pattern typical for sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation; clinical context and additional ECG leads should be reviewed by a clinician for definitive interpretation.
