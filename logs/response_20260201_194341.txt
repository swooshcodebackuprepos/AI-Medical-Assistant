The rhythm strip visible on the right side of the screen is consistent with a Normal Sinus Rhythm.

Clinically structured interpretation:
- Rate: Approximately 60-100 beats per minute (normal rate)
- Rhythm: Regular
- P wave: Present before each QRS complex with consistent morphology, indicating sinus origin
- PR interval: Normal duration (0.12-0.20 seconds)
- QRS duration: Normal (narrow complexes)
- Overall interpretation: Normal sinus rhythm, indicating normal electrical conduction and heart rate

Confidence: High, given the presence of a P wave before each QRS, a regular rhythm, and normal heart rate and intervals.

Decision support only; final clinical interpretation must be confirmed by a qualified healthcare professional.
