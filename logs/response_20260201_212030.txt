1) Most likely rhythm:
Sinus tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate approximately 110-130 bpm (tachycardic)
- Regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes
- Narrow QRS complexes (<0.12 seconds)
- P waves present but small/less distinct, likely consistent before each QRS
- Consistent PR interval suggesting normal AV conduction
- No ectopic beats or irregularities seen

3) Key differentials and distinction:
- Sinus tachycardia: Regular rhythm, P waves precede each QRS, narrow QRS
- Atrial flutter with 2:1 conduction: Usually sawtooth flutter waves and regular narrow QRS, but no clear flutter waves here
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): Usually very fast rate >150 bpm, often with absent or hidden P waves; here P waves are likely present

4) Confidence: High – clear narrow QRS, regular rate and rhythm, P waves present, and rate consistent with sinus tachycardia.

5) Safety note: This is decision support only; clinician must confirm and consider clinical context.
