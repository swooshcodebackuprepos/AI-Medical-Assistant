The rhythm visible on the EKG strip in the image is identified as "Atrial Flutter."

Clinical reasoning:
- There is a characteristic sawtooth pattern of flutter waves visible.
- The ventricular response appears regular.
- This pattern aligns with typical atrial flutter rather than fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias.

Confidence: Moderate to high based on the visible atrial flutter wave morphology.

Note: Clinician confirmation is necessary for final diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
