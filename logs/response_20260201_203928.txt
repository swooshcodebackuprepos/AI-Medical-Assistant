The visible rhythm strip on the right side of the screen shows a very fast, regular, narrow complex rhythm without visible distinct P waves. This suggests a diagnosis of sinus tachycardia given the multiple-choice options, as the rhythm is fast but appears organized.

The EKG AI assistant on the left side states:
- Normal (N) confidence = 0.959
- Other/Rare confidence = 0.040

However, the rhythm strip visually corresponds better to sinus tachycardia rather than normal sinus rhythm or sinus bradycardia.

Clinical Impression:
- Rhythm: Sinus tachycardia
- Confidence: Moderate to high based on visual analysis and the context of options, but confirm with the clinician's interpretation.

Clinician review and confirmation are essential for final diagnosis.
