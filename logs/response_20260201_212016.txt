1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus Tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 110-120 bpm (fast rate but regular).
- Regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes.
- P waves are present but small; appear before each QRS complex indicating atrial depolarization.
- PR interval seems constant and within normal limits.
- QRS complexes are narrow (<0.12 sec).
- No ectopic beats or irregularities observed.

3) Key differentials and distinctions:
- Sinus Tachycardia: P waves present before each QRS, regular rhythm, narrow QRS.
- Atrial Tachycardia: Usually has abnormal P wave morphology different from sinus P waves.
- Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Often sudden onset, regular rhythm, P waves may be hidden or abnormal.
Distinguish by careful analysis of P wave morphology and timing, and patient clinical context.

4) Confidence: High – The strip clearly shows a narrow QRS complex regular tachycardia with identifiable P waves consistent with sinus tachycardia.

5) Safety note: This is decision-support only; a clinician must confirm diagnosis and clinical correlation is essential.
