The visible rhythm strip on the right side of the screen shows normal P waves before each QRS complex, regular rhythm, and an overall slower heart rate consistent with sinus bradycardia. There is no evidence of a prolonged PR interval to suggest a first-degree AV block.

Clinically structured interpretation:
- Heart rate: Slow, consistent with bradycardia (<60 beats per minute)
- Rhythm: Regular
- P wave: Present before each QRS, consistent morphology (sinus origin)
- PR interval: Normal (not prolonged)
- QRS duration: Normal (narrow complexes)
- Overall interpretation: Sinus bradycardia

Confidence in this interpretation is high based on the visible features of the rhythm strip.
