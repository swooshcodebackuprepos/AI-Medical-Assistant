The rhythm visible on the EKG strip in the image is identified as "Atrial Flutter."

Clinical reasoning:
- The characteristic sawtooth pattern of flutter waves is noted.
- The ventricular response appears regular.
- This pattern is typical of atrial flutter rather than fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias.

Confidence: Moderate to high based on the visible atrial flutter wave morphology.

Clinician confirmation is necessary for diagnosis and clinical decision-making.
