The visible screen image shows a document with three EKG strips labeled 1, 2, and 3, each with separate sections for "Rate," "reg," "P wave," "P/QRS," "PR," and "QRS" intervals to be filled in. The strips display different rhythms. The first strip appears to have a normal sinus rhythm with regular intervals. The second strip shows irregular, possibly atrial fibrillation or another irregular rhythm with varying P waves and intervals. The third strip shows a faster rhythm, possibly sinus tachycardia or supraventricular tachycardia given the rapid rate.

The terminal window on the right side shows commands running Python scripts related to EKG analysis using an AI system, with "Top predictions" indicating a high confidence for "Normal (N)" at 0.929 and "Other/Rare" at 0.071 for an analyzed image.

Regarding your question about sinus bradycardia, the EKG strips shown in the image do not clearly exhibit sinus bradycardia (which is characterized by a slow heart rate, typically less than 60 bpm, with regular P waves). The first strip looks closer to normal sinus rhythm, the second irregular, and the third faster rhythm.

Confidence: Moderate. The rhythm strips are visible but small, limiting detailed analysis. Clinical confirmation and EKG measurement are essential.

Recommendation: Review actual patient EKG strips closely and measure heart rate and intervals to confirm sinus bradycardia before clinical decision-making.
