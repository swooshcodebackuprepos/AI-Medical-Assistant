Clinically structured interpretation of the visible rhythm strip on the right side of the screen and the AI assistant's analysis:

- Heart rate: Appears slow, consistent with bradycardia (<60 beats per minute)
- Rhythm: Regular
- P wave: Present before each QRS complex, consistent morphology indicating sinus origin
- PR interval: Normal duration (0.12-0.20 seconds), not prolonged
- QRS duration: Normal (narrow complexes)
- Overall interpretation: Sinus bradycardia

Confidence level: High, based on the presence of normal P waves before each QRS, regular rhythm, normal intervals, and slower heart rate consistent with sinus bradycardia.
