Clinically structured interpretation of EKG strips 13 and 14:

Strip 13:
- Rhythm: Regular
- Rate: Approximately 75 beats per minute (based on spacing on the grid)
- P waves: Present, uniform shape before each QRS complex
- PR interval: Normal duration (120-200 ms)
- QRS complex: Normal duration, narrow complexes
- QT interval: Within normal limits
- Interpretation: Normal sinus rhythm

Strip 14:
- Rhythm: Irregularly irregular
- Rate: Variable and slower than strip 13
- P waves: Absent or not clearly visible, irregular baseline
- QRS complex: Normal duration, narrow complexes
- Interpretation: Atrial fibrillation (likely with varying ventricular response)

Confidence: Moderate to high for normal sinus rhythm in strip 13 and atrial fibrillation in strip 14, based on typical features seen. Clinical correlation and confirmation by a cardiologist or experienced clinician is advised.
