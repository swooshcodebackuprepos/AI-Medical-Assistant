The image does not clearly show an EKG rhythm strip. The visible strip is very faint, lacking discernible waveforms such as P waves, QRS complexes, or T waves.

Next steps:
- Obtain a clearer, higher-quality EKG rhythm strip.
- Ensure proper electrode placement and machine settings.
- Capture a full 10-second rhythm strip if possible for thorough analysis.

Please provide a clearer EKG image for accurate rhythm analysis.
