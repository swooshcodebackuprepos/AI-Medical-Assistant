The AI analysis in the image indicates the following for the two strips:

**Strip 4:**
- Rate: Approximately 70–80 bpm (regular intervals)
- Rhythm: Regular, with evenly spaced QRS complexes
- P waves: Present before every QRS
- PR interval and QRS morphology: Normal
- Interpretation: Normal sinus rhythm
- Confidence: Moderate to high

**Strip 5:**
- Rate: Very slow, approximately 30–40 bpm
- Rhythm: Regular, consistent QRS spacing
- P waves: Not clearly visible or absent before QRS
- Interpretation: Likely idioventricular or junctional escape rhythm due to slow rate and unclear/absent P waves
- Confidence: Moderate

The clinician's assertion that strip 4 shows atrial flutter (a-flutter) and strip 5 shows atrial fibrillation (a-fib) differs from the AI's findings. The AI did not find atrial flutter (which typically presents with "sawtooth" flutter waves and a regular fast atrial rate) in strip 4, nor evidence of atrial fibrillation (irregularly irregular rhythm with absent distinct P waves) in strip 5.

Given this discrepancy, the clinical interpretation provided by the AI should be considered decision-support only. Clinical correlation with full EKG tracings, multiple leads, patient symptoms, and expert electrophysiology review is necessary to confirm the rhythm diagnoses of a-flutter and a-fib.

**Confidence:** Moderate (AI findings); clinician expertise is required to confirm or override.
