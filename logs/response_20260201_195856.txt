The text from the displayed EKG AI Assistant analysis states the following:

- The EKG shows a characteristic sawtooth pattern of flutter waves.
- The ventricular response appears regular.
- This pattern aligns with typical atrial flutter rather than fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias.
- Confidence in this interpretation is moderate to high based on visible atrial flutter wave morphology.
- Local ML model confidence: Normal rhythm 92.4%, other/rare 7.6%.
- Atrial Flutter is the rhythm visible on the EKG strip.
- The diagnosis requires clinician confirmation for final decision-making.

Therefore, the AI system does not indicate normal sinus rhythm in this EKG; it suggests atrial flutter with regular ventricular response. 

Confidence in this interpretation is moderate to high per AI, but clinical confirmation and review of the actual EKG tracing is necessary before final diagnosis.

Summary:
- Rhythm visible: Atrial flutter (not normal sinus rhythm)
- Pattern: Sawtooth flutter waves, regular ventricular response
- AI confidence: Moderate to high
- Clinical confirmation required

Please have the clinician verify the rhythm interpretation against the actual EKG strip.
