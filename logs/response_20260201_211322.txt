Based on the visible EKG rhythm strip displayed on the screen and the AI assistant's textual interpretation:

- The rhythm is characterized by very rapid, wide complex QRS tachycardia.
- P waves are absent or not discernible, indicating no clear atrial activity.
- The rhythm is described as rapid and regular.
- These features suggest ventricular tachycardia (VT) rather than a third-degree AV block.
- The reported diagnosis of third-degree heart block mentioned in the system text is likely incorrect, as third-degree AV block typically shows AV dissociation with distinct P waves.

Regarding your question about an "irregularly regular" rhythm: The rhythm visible here appears more regular than irregular, as the QRS complexes are spaced evenly in this strip.

Confidence: High for ventricular tachycardia (rapid, wide complex, regular rhythm with absent P waves). The rhythm does not appear irregularly irregular but rather regular.
