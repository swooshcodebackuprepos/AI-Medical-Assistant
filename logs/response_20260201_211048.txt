The rhythm strip visible in the screen image shows a very rapid, wide-complex tachycardia with no discernible P waves. The QRS complexes are wide and occur in a regular, rapid pattern.

Key observations:
- Wide QRS complexes
- Rapid regular rhythm
- Absence of visible P waves or associated P waves
- No AV dissociation clearly visible

These features are most consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia (VT) rather than a third-degree heart block, which typically shows AV dissociation with independent P waves and QRS complexes.

Confidence level: High that this is ventricular tachycardia based on the described features in the rhythm strip.

Note: This is decision-support information. Clinical correlation and confirmation by a qualified clinician with full clinical context and a 12-lead ECG is essential.
