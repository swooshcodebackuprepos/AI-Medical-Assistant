The correct rhythm for number 10 is "Ventricular tachycardia."

Explanation:
- The AI interpretation visible on the left side of the image describes the rhythm strip as showing a very rapid, regular wide-complex tachycardia with no discernible P waves.
- This finding is consistent with ventricular tachycardia (V-tach).
- The differential excludes other rhythms with narrow QRS complexes or visible P waves before QRS complexes.
- Confidence in the diagnosis is high based on features such as wide QRS complexes, rapid regular rhythm, and absence of P waves.
- The user query about having all choices also shows the option "Ventricular tachycardia" on the right side of the image, which matches the AI's diagnosis.

Note: As always, clinical confirmation and correlation with patient presentation are essential.

Confidence: High for ventricular tachycardia based on described features and AI analysis.
