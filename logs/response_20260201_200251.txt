Clinical Analysis:

- The image on the right displays an EKG rhythm strip.
- The visible waveform on the EKG strip shows a characteristic sawtooth pattern consistent with atrial flutter waves.
- The ventricular response appears regular, which is typical for atrial flutter rather than asystole.
- There is no flat horizontal line that would indicate asystole (absence of electrical activity).
- The AI assistant's analysis on the left confirms this interpretation, with moderate to high confidence, indicating atrial flutter and rejecting the idea of a normal sinus rhythm or asystole.

Confidence: Moderate to high confidence for atrial flutter pattern and no evidence supporting asystole based on the visible waveform morphology.

Recommendation: Confirm diagnosis by reviewing the full EKG strip clinically, as AI interpretations require clinical validation.

Summary: The wave is not a flat horizontal line (asystole) but shows typical atrial flutter sawtooth waves with a regular ventricular response.
