The rhythm visible in the EKG strip on the screen image is characterized by wide QRS complexes and a very rapid, regular rhythm with no discernible P waves. These findings are consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VTach).

Key points supporting this interpretation:
- Wide QRS complexes rather than narrow complexes.
- Absence of visible P waves.
- Rapid, regular rhythm.
- The note from the AI system cautions against a prior incorrect interpretation as sinus tachycardia and favors ventricular tachycardia.
- Confidence is high for ventricular tachycardia based on these features.

Decision-support recommendation: The final diagnosis should be confirmed by a treating clinician using clinical correlation and manual EKG review.

Confidence: High for ventricular tachycardia based on the described EKG features and AI interpretation summary.

Clinician confirmation is essential before making treatment decisions.
