The screenshot shows two separate EKG rhythm strips labeled as 1 and 2.

For each strip, there are corresponding fields to analyze and fill in:
1. Rate
2. Regularity (reg)
3. P wave characteristics
4. Relationship of P wave to QRS complex (P/QRS)
5. PR interval duration
6. QRS complex duration

The first strip appears to have a regular rhythm with consistent P waves prior to each QRS complex and a relatively normal QRS complex. The second strip shows a rhythm with identifiable P waves but less frequent compared to the first strip.

This setup seems to be a practice or teaching tool for cardiac rhythm interpretation.

Confidence in the content description: High.
Clinical interpretation of the strips is not complete without measurements and further clinical data; clinician input is necessary to confirm diagnoses or conclusions.
