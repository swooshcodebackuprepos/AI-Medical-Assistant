The rhythm visible on the EKG identified by the AI assistant is atrial flutter, not normal sinus rhythm. 

Key points from the analysis:
- The EKG shows characteristic sawtooth flutter waves.
- Ventricular response is regular.
- Pattern aligns with typical atrial flutter rather than atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias.
- AI confidence level is moderate to high.
- Local model confidence is approximately 92.4% for normal rhythm and 7.6% for other/rare, supporting atrial flutter diagnosis.
- Clinical confirmation and review of the actual EKG tracing is strongly advised before final diagnosis.

Summary:
- Rhythm: Atrial flutter
- Pattern: Sawtooth flutter waves with regular ventricular response
- Confidence: Moderate to high AI confidence
- Clinical confirmation required

This is a decision-support output and clinician verification is necessary.
