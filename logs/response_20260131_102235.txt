The image contains multiple small EKG strips stacked vertically but is too small and unclear to analyze any specific EKG rhythm strip with clarity.

1) Most likely rhythm: Not determinable from the current image.
2) Supporting features: Not assessable due to low resolution and size of strips.
3) Key differentials: Cannot be distinguished without a clear EKG strip.
4) Confidence: Low - image quality and size do not permit confident rhythm analysis.
5) Safety note: Please provide a larger, clearer, and zoomed-in image of a single rhythm strip for accurate assessment. Clinician confirmation is necessary for any rhythm interpretation.
