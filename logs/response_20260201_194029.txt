The rhythm visible in strip 3 is Sinus Tachycardia.

Clinically structured interpretation:
- Rate: Approximately 130-150 beats per minute (tachycardic)
- Rhythm: Regular
- P wave: Present before each QRS, consistent morphology (indicating sinus origin)
- PR interval: Normal
- QRS duration: Normal (narrow complexes)
- Overall interpretation: Sinus tachycardia, which is a normal sinus rhythm but with an elevated heart rate.

Confidence: High, given the clear sinus P waves and regular, narrow QRS complexes with elevated rate.

Decision support only; please confirm with clinical context and a cardiologist if needed.
