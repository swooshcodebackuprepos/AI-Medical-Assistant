The screen image shows a webpage from an EKG practice test, specifically question 5 of 14, asking the user to choose the correct rhythm for a displayed rhythm strip.

The rhythm strip shown at the bottom of the webpage demonstrates clear QRS complexes with preceding P waves at a regular interval, consistent with a normal sinus rhythm. The rate appears within normal limits, the rhythm is regular, and there are no abnormalities such as rapid rates, absent P waves, or irregular irregularity.

Options provided on the webpage include:
- Normal sinus rhythm
- Sinus tachycardia
- Sinus bradycardia
- SVT (supraventricular tachycardia)
- Atrial flutter
- Atrial fibrillation

Based on the visible rhythm strip, the most appropriate classification is Normal Sinus Rhythm.

Confidence: High

Note: This is decision-support based on image interpretation; clinician confirmation is essential.
