The visible rhythm strip on the right side of the screen shows a rapid, wide-complex tachycardia with a regular rhythm, which is consistent with ventricular tachycardia (V tachy). 

Key features supporting this interpretation:
- Broad QRS complexes
- Fast ventricular rate (tachycardia)
- Absence of clear P waves preceding every QRS complex
- Regular rhythm pattern

This differs from sinus rhythms, which show narrow QRS complexes and clear P waves before each QRS.

Confidence: High, based on the morphology and rate visible in the rhythm strip, but final clinical confirmation is necessary.

Decision support only; clinician must confirm.
