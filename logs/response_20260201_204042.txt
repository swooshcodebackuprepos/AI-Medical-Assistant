The rhythm strip presented in the image shows a very rapid, regular wide-complex tachycardia without discernible P waves, consistent with ventricular tachycardia (V-tach). The waveform has a broad QRS morphology, which helps differentiate it from sinus tachycardia, which would present with a narrow QRS and visible P waves preceding each QRS complex.

Key points suggesting V-tach over sinus tachycardia:
- Wide QRS complexes
- Rapid and regular rhythm
- Absence of visible P waves
- Morphology typical for ventricular origin

Therefore, the correct interpretation is ventricular tachycardia, not sinus tachycardia.

Confidence level: High, based on the classic features visible in the EKG strip.

Clinician should confirm the diagnosis and clinical context for appropriate management.
