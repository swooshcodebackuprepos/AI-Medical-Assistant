The image does not clearly show an EKG rhythm strip. It appears to be a screenshot of a flashcard question with a small, unclear EKG strip that is difficult to analyze due to low resolution and size.

Next steps:
- Obtain a clearer, larger EKG rhythm strip image.
- Ensure multiple QRS complexes and intervals are visible for proper analysis.
- Then provide the EKG strip for evaluation.

As is, there is insufficient detail to analyze the rhythm or provide a clinical interpretation.
