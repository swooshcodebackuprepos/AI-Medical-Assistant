The number 2 in the image corresponds to the second EKG strip displayed on the page. Clinically, it represents a tracing of the heart's electrical activity which can be analyzed for:

1. Heart rate
2. Regularity of rhythm
3. P wave presence and morphology
4. PR interval duration
5. PR segment
6. QRS complex duration

The second EKG strip shows one cardiac cycle with discernible P waves and QRS complexes, indicating a normal sinus rhythm or similar pattern. The exact rate and intervals are meant to be filled in by the user.

Confidence: High for identification as an EKG strip; analysis of exact rhythm and intervals requires further measurement and clinical correlation.

Please confirm with a clinician for detailed interpretation and diagnosis.
