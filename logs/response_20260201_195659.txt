The rhythm visible on the EKG strip in the image corresponds to "Atrial Flutter."

Clinical reasoning:
- The EKG shows a characteristic sawtooth pattern of flutter waves.
- The ventricular response is regular.
- This pattern is consistent with typical atrial flutter rather than other supraventricular tachycardias or sinus rhythms.

Confidence: Moderate to high based on the visible atrial flutter wave morphology.

Note: Confirmation by a clinician through direct review of the EKG tracing and clinical context is necessary for a definitive diagnosis and treatment decisions.
