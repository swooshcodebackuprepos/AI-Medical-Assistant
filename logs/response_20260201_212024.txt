1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate is elevated, approximately 110-130 bpm (tachycardic)
- Regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes
- P waves are present but may be small or attenuated, preceding each QRS complex
- PR interval appears consistent and normal in duration
- QRS complexes are narrow, indicating supraventricular origin
- No evident ectopy or arrhythmic interruptions

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish each:
- Sinus tachycardia: Regular rhythm, P waves present and consistent before each QRS, narrow QRS
- Atrial tachycardia: May have abnormal P wave morphology; however, P waves are generally visible and regular
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): Usually no visible P waves or P waves are buried in T waves; rate often faster (>150 bpm)

4) Confidence: High - Clear regular narrow QRS complexes with visible P waves and consistent intervals suggest sinus tachycardia.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm interpretation and correlate with clinical context.
