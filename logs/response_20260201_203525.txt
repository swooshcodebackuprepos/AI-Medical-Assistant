Based on the visible content in the image, this is a screenshot from an EKG practice test webpage displaying an EKG rhythm strip. The rhythm strip shows:

- Clear, regular P waves each followed by QRS complexes
- The rate is elevated, consistent with tachycardia

The selected and correct answer on the webpage is "Sinus tachycardia."

Key points for this interpretation:
- Regular rhythm
- P wave before each QRS, consistent with sinus origin
- Elevated heart rate fitting tachycardia

This supports the diagnosis of sinus tachycardia for the rhythm strip in the image.

Confidence: High

Note: This interpretation is decision-support only; clinical confirmation by a qualified provider is essential.
