The rhythm visible in the ECG strip is **Sinus Tachycardia**. 

This conclusion is based on the following features seen in the rhythm strip:
- Regular waveform pattern.
- Rate appears to be fast, generally over 100 beats per minute.
- Presence of narrow QRS complexes consistent with sinus rhythm.
- No irregularity or abnormalities indicative of other arrhythmias like bradycardia or abnormal rhythms.

Confidence: High for Sinus Tachycardia based on standard rhythm strip characteristics.

Clinical confirmation recommended.
