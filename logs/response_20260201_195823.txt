Clinical Interpretation:

- The rhythm visible on the EKG strip corresponds to "Atrial Flutter."
- Characteristics: 
  - Atypical sawtooth pattern of flutter waves is present.
  - The ventricular response appears regular.
  - This pattern aligns with typical atrial flutter rather than atrial fibrillation or other supraventricular tachycardias or sinus rhythms.
  
Confidence:

- Moderate to high confidence based on the visible atrial flutter wave morphology and ventricular response regularity.
- Local machine learning model results showed a high confidence (0.924) in the normal pattern vs. other or rare.

Note:

- Clinician confirmation is necessary to finalize diagnosis and treatment decisions based on comprehensive clinical context and direct EKG review.

Summary: The rhythm is consistent with atrial flutter with a regular ventricular response, and this assessment has moderate to high confidence.
