The screen image presents a rhythm strip analysis and identifies the rhythm as ventricular tachycardia (V-tach), not sinus tachycardia.

Key observed features supporting this diagnosis include:
- Very rapid, regular rhythm with a rate generally over 100 beats per minute.
- Presence of wide QRS complexes.
- Absence of discernible P waves before each QRS complex.
- Morphology typical for ventricular origin rather than supraventricular origin.

There is high confidence in this interpretation based on the classic EKG features visible in the strip. However, clinical confirmation is advised by a healthcare professional to ensure appropriate clinical context and management.

Summary:
- Rhythm: Ventricular tachycardia (V-tach)
- Confidence: High based on EKG features
- Recommendation: Clinical confirmation necessary

Please ensure this finding is corroborated by a cardiologist or a qualified clinician.
