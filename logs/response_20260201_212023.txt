1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 100-130 bpm (based on the distance between QRS complexes)
- Regularity: Regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes
- P waves: P waves present but not clearly discernible, possibly buried in preceding T waves due to tachycardia
- PR interval: Fixed and consistent (not clearly measurable here)
- QRS width: Narrow QRS complexes
- No ectopy or abnormal beats visible

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish each:
- Sinus tachycardia: Regular rhythm, narrow QRS, presence of P waves before each QRS, rate >100 bpm but less than 150 bpm typically
- Atrial tachycardia: Usually regular rhythm and tachycardic but P wave morphology differs from sinus P waves; often abnormal P wave axis
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): Regular narrow complex tachycardia, rate often higher (>150 bpm), P waves often absent or buried in QRS or T wave; abrupt onset and offset clinically

4) Confidence: Medium to high – The strip shows a regular narrow complex tachycardia with P waves visible though not very distinct, consistent with sinus tachycardia. The rate is at upper limit of normal or mildly elevated, favoring sinus tachycardia rather than SVT.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm by reviewing full 12-lead EKG and clinical context.
