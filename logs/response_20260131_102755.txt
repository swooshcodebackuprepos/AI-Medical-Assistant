1) Most likely rhythm: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 120-150 bpm (calculated by counting QRS complexes per time)
- Regularity: Irregularly irregular rhythm
- P waves: Absent or fibrillatory baseline waves, no distinct P waves
- PR interval: Not measurable due to absent P waves
- QRS width: Normal (narrow QRS complexes)
- No ectopic beats clearly identified

3) Key differentials and distinctions:
- Atrial flutter with variable block: Would show 'sawtooth' flutter waves, usually regular atrial activity
- Multifocal atrial tachycardia: Presence of at least three different P wave morphologies, irregular rhythm but identifiable P waves
- Sinus tachycardia with frequent PACs: Presence of normal P waves before QRS complexes, usually more regular rhythm

4) Confidence: High – Classic irregularly irregular rhythm without P waves and normal QRS supports atrial fibrillation diagnosis.

5) Safety note: This is decision-support only; diagnosing and managing arrhythmias must be confirmed and guided by a qualified clinician.
