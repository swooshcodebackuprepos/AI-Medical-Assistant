1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus Tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 110 bpm (faster than normal sinus rate).
- Regularity: Regular rhythm with consistent R-R intervals.
- P waves: Present and precede each QRS complex, although not very prominent.
- PR interval: Appears fixed and within normal range.
- QRS width: Narrow complexes, indicating normal ventricular conduction.
- No ectopic beats or irregularities noted.

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish:
- Sinus Tachycardia: Presence of normal P waves, regular rhythm, and narrow QRS.
- Atrial Tachycardia: Would have abnormal or absent P waves, or abnormal P wave morphology.
- Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Typically has very rapid rate, often >150 bpm, and may have absent or hidden P waves.

4) Confidence: High - Based on clear narrow QRS, regular rhythm, and identifiable P waves preceding each QRS.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm the clinical context and diagnosis.
