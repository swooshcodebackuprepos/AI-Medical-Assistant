Confidence: High

Based on the visible content in the image, this is a screenshot from an EKG practice test. The rhythm strip displayed shows a regular atrial activity with sawtooth-shaped flutter waves, characteristic of "Atrial Flutter."

Key points supporting this interpretation:
- The rhythm strip has a repetitive pattern suggesting flutter waves.
- The answer selected and marked as correct on the webpage is "Atrial Flutter."
- Other rhythm options like normal sinus rhythm, first-degree heart block, sinus tachycardia, sinus bradycardia, and SVT are listed but not selected.

This suggests the correct rhythm diagnosis visible is "Atrial Flutter."

Note: This interpretation is decision-support only based on the screenshot content; clinical confirmation by a qualified provider is essential.
