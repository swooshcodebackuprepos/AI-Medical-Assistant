1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 110-130 bpm (fast)
- Regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes
- Narrow QRS complexes (<120 ms)
- P waves generally visible before each QRS, although small
- PR interval fixed and consistent
- No obvious ectopic beats or abnormalities in QRS morphology

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish:
- Sinus tachycardia: Regular rhythm, narrow QRS, P waves present and consistent before QRS
- Atrial flutter with 2:1 block: Typically sawtooth flutter waves visible, regular rhythm about 150 bpm or 75 bpm if 4:1 block; no distinct P waves but flutter waves instead
- Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT): Regular narrow QRS tachycardia, P waves often hidden within or after QRS, abrupt onset/offset in clinical context

4) Confidence: High – Clear narrow QRS, regular rhythm, and P waves before QRS visible support sinus tachycardia strongly.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm with full ECG and clinical correlation.
