1) Most likely rhythm: Sinus Tachycardia

2) Supporting features:
- Rate is increased; tachycardic (approximately 120 bpm based on the strip length and number of complexes).
- Rhythm is regular with consistent R-R intervals.
- P waves are present before each QRS complex, though small and not very prominent.
- PR interval appears consistent and normal in duration.
- QRS complexes are narrow and uniform in shape.
- No ectopic beats or irregularities apparent.

3) Key differentials and how to distinguish:
- Sinus Tachycardia: Presence of P waves before each QRS, regular rhythm, narrow QRS.
- Atrial Flutter with fixed conduction: Usually sawtooth flutter waves visible instead of discrete P waves; rate and pattern differ.
- Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT): Usually no clear P waves, abrupt onset/offset, often faster rate; may require clinical correlation.

4) Confidence: High – Clear regular rhythm with identifiable P waves and narrow QRS favors sinus tachycardia.

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm diagnosis and consider clinical context and full 12-lead ECG if available.
