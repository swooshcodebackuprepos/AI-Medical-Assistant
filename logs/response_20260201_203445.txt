Based on the visible content in the image, this is a screenshot from an EKG practice test. The rhythm strip displayed shows clear, regular P waves followed by QRS complexes at a rate suggestive of a rapid atrial rhythm. The answer selected and marked as correct on the webpage is "Sinus tachycardia."

Key points supporting this interpretation:
- The rhythm is regular.
- There is a P wave before each QRS complex, consistent with sinus rhythm.
- The heart rate appears elevated, consistent with tachycardia.
- The other answer options visible like normal sinus rhythm and sinus bradycardia are listed but not selected.
   
This suggests the correct rhythm diagnosis visible is "Sinus tachycardia."

Note: This interpretation is decision-support only based on the screenshot content; clinical confirmation by a qualified provider is essential. 

Confidence: High
