1) Most likely rhythm: Normal Sinus Rhythm

2) Supporting features:
- Rate: Approximately 75 beats per minute (based on intervals between QRS complexes)
- Regularity: Regular rhythm with consistent R-R intervals
- P waves: Present before each QRS complex, uniform morphology
- PR interval: Constant and within normal limits (~0.12-0.20 seconds)
- QRS width: Narrow and normal duration (~<0.12 seconds)
- No ectopic beats or irregularities noted

3) Key differentials and distinctions:
- Sinus Bradycardia: Would have similar morphology but rate typically below 60 bpm
- Sinus Tachycardia: Similar pattern but rate above 100 bpm
- Atrial Fibrillation: Characterized by absent discrete P waves and irregularly irregular rhythm, not seen here

4) Confidence: High, because features clearly demonstrate regular sinus rhythm with identifiable P waves and normal intervals

5) Safety note: Decision-support only; clinician must confirm with full 12-lead ECG and clinical correlation.
