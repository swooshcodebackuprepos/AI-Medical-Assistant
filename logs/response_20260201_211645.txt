Based on the visible ECG rhythm strip in the image:

- The QRS complexes appear narrow, not wide.
- There is a regular rhythm with fixed intervals between QRS complexes.
- P waves are not clearly discernible or associated in the strip shown.
- The rhythm appears stable with no obvious irregularity in the QRS complexes.

These features are indicative of a narrow complex tachycardia with a regular rhythm and stable rate, consistent with **Sinus tachycardia**.

Confidence: High

Note: Clinical correlation and a full 12-lead ECG review are necessary for definitive diagnosis.
