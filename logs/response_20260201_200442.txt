The screen image shows a webpage from an EKG practice test, asking the user to choose the correct rhythm for the displayed rhythm strip. The rhythm strip shown appears to be a flat line, which typically represents asystole or absence of electrical activity in the heart.

Options provided include:
- Normal sinus rhythm
- Sinus tachycardia
- Sinus bradycardia
- SVT (supraventricular tachycardia)
- Atrial flutter
- Atrial fibrillation

Given the visible flat line rhythm strip, none of the above options accurately describe asystole. This may be an issue with the displayed strip or an incomplete capture.

Confidence: High that the strip shows a flat line/asystole, which is not among the given options. Clinical confirmation and validation of the rhythm strip quality is recommended.

If you would like, I can assist with further interpretation or next steps.
